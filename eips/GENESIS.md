# Bit Brains Genesis Parameters

This document defines the initial conditions, allocations, identity structure, and participation rules for the Bit Brains protocol at Genesis.

Genesis parameters are not protocol invariants. They may evolve through governance, future EIPs, or community consensus without violating core protocol principles defined in the EIP series.

---

## Genesis Overview

- Purpose of the Genesis Brain stage
- Relationship to EIP-0001, EIP-0002, EIP-0003, and EIP-0004
- Establishment of identity, participation, and Proof-of-Care foundations

---

## Genesis Brain Supply

- **Total Genesis Brains:** 1,500  
- **Public Allocation:** 1,300  
- **Team / Treasury Allocation:** 200  

Team and treasury Brains are subject to protocol-defined lockups and usage policies and are not intended for immediate extraction or speculation.

---

## Genesis Brain Utility

Genesis Brains function as participation primitives within the protocol and enable:

- Eligibility for Proof-of-Care epochs
- Eligibility for BIT reward accrual
- Eligibility for future Cerebral evolution
- Identity anchoring via ENS

---

## ENS Identity at Genesis

Upon minting, each Genesis Brain is assigned an **ENS subdomain** incorporating its Brain number.

This ENS identity:
- Persists throughout the Brain lifecycle
- Evolves alongside Cerebral minting
- Enables composability, reputation, and future coordination
- Serves as the foundation for future autonomous and economic behavior

---

## Proof-of-Care and Epoch Participation

Genesis Brains may stake and provide Proof-of-Care across the initial epochs:

### Epochs 1–3
- Brains stake and demonstrate Proof-of-Care
- BIT rewards accrue based on participation
- No final reward distribution occurs before the end of Epoch 3
- Staking reward parameters are announced after Epoch 2

### Epochs 4–5
- Full Brain staking commitment is evaluated
- Long-term alignment is measured
- Cerebral minting outcomes are finalized

---

## Genesis Reward Routing (Updated)

Genesis rewards **are not a fixed 80% / 20% split**.

Instead:
- Rewards are distributed from the **protocol treasury**
- Distribution is based on:
  - Proof-of-Care
  - Sustained staking
  - Epoch participation
  - Governance-defined parameters

Treasury allocations may support:
- Ecosystem growth
- Liquidity defense
- Infrastructure
- Future reward programs

No Genesis reward allocation guarantees permanent percentages.

---

## Staking and Reward Mechanics

- Genesis Brains must stake and provide Proof-of-Care during Epochs 1–3 to be eligible for rewards
- BIT rewards are minted after Epoch 3
- Staking rewards are distributed from the treasury
- Reward rates and mechanisms may evolve via governance

The protocol favors **long-term alignment over short-term extraction**.

---

## Transition to Cerebral Stage

Each Genesis Brain is eligible to evolve into the Cerebral stage.

- All eligible Brains receive a minimum of **one (1) Cerebral**
- Brains that fully stake earned BIT rewards and maintain full staking through **Epochs 4 and 5** may receive **two (2) Cerebrals**
- Partial participation results in one (1) Cerebral

This structure rewards conviction without enforcing compulsory behavior.

---

## Future Autonomy and Evolution

Brains and Cerebrals may autonomously follow different evolutionary paths in the future.

However:
- Staking
- Proof-of-Care
- Belief in the protocol’s assets

remain the essential drivers of growth.

The more care demonstrated and the stronger the long-term alignment, the greater the potential rewards.

---

## Community Expansion

- Team-owned Brains reserved for future community distribution
- Distribution occurs after the Cerebral stage
- Objective: decentralization, onboarding, and long-term sustainability

---

## Closing Notes

Genesis establishes the foundation for identity, participation, and alignment within the Bit Brains protocol.

It is intentionally flexible, governance-aware, and designed to evolve alongside the protocol itself
