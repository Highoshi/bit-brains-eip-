## Abstract

This EIP defines the Cerebral NFT layer within the Bit Brains ecosystem. Cerebrals function as the secondary participation layer following Brains, enabling staking, reward distribution, identity representation, and progressive evolution toward autonomous intelligence components.

This proposal establishes the structure, purpose, reward pathways, and expansion mechanics of Cerebrals while preserving long-term sustainability, proof-of-care incentives, and ecosystem continuity.

---

## Motivation

The Bit Brains protocol is designed to reward long-term alignment, continuity, and constructive participation. While Brains represent the genesis and backbone of the ecosystem, Cerebrals provide an active execution layer that enables growth, experimentation, and scalable participation.

This EIP introduces Cerebrals to:
- Expand participation without diluting core stewardship
- Enable staking-based reward distribution
- Support identity, ENS, and signaling primitives
- Create a progression path toward economic and autonomous utility

---

## Definitions

- **Brain**  
  The genesis NFT representing the earliest and longest-lived commitment to the Bit Brains ecosystem.

- **Cerebral**  
  An ERC-721 NFT derived from Brains or authorized expansions, serving as a staking, participation, and reward-accrual primitive.

- **Proof of Care**  
  Sustained participation, staking continuity, and ecosystem-aligned behavior over time.

- **Expansion Epoch**  
  A governance-authorized event introducing additional Cerebrals to support ecosystem growth.

- **Real World Assets (RWA)**  
  Tokenized or represented economic activities, goods, or services that exist outside purely digital contexts.  
  Within the Bit Brains ecosystem, matured Brains may transition into economic proofs of goods and services when utilized in a technologically sound manner. These RWAs serve as verifiable extensions of Brain intelligence and stewardship into real-world production, coordination, and value creation. Further specifications will be introduced as the protocol evolves.

## Cerebral Overview

Cerebrals are ERC-721 NFTs that represent active participation within the Bit Brains ecosystem. They serve as the primary interface for staking, reward distribution, identity signaling, and future autonomous intelligence development.

Cerebrals may be:
- Earned through Brain participation
- Minted during authorized Expansion Epochs
- Utilized for staking and reward accrual
- Evolved into higher-order components over time

---

## Genesis Cerebrals

Each Brain is entitled to mint up to **two (2) Genesis Cerebrals** through defined staking and participation mechanisms.

Genesis Cerebrals represent early alignment and inherit preferential reward pathways relative to later expansion participants, subject to proof-of-care requirements.

---

## Brain-to-Cerebral Progression and Minting Eligibility

Brains that complete the Brain stage may optionally qualify to mint up to **two (2) Cerebral tokens**.

Eligibility requirements:
- The Brain participant must fully stake:
  - All earned Brain-stage BIT rewards
  - Associated Brain participation rewards
- Full staking must be maintained continuously throughout:
  - Epoch 4
  - Epoch 5 of the Brain stage

Epoch 3 serves as the reward realization epoch in which BIT becomes available and is not subject to continuity staking requirements.

Partial staking or early withdrawal during Epochs 4 or 5 disqualifies the Brain from dual Cerebral eligibility.

---

## Expansion Cerebrals

To support ecosystem growth and broader participation, the protocol authorizes Expansion Cerebrals through governance-approved Expansion Epochs.

Expansion Cerebrals:
- Are minted under defined supply constraints
- Receive lower base reward pathways than Genesis Cerebrals
- Retain the ability to increase reward capacity through sustained proof of care

### Expansion Epoch I

- **Total Cerebrals Minted:** 1,100  
- **Public Allocation:** 1,000  
- **Community Allocation:** 100  
- **Team Allocation:** 0  

Community-allocated Cerebrals are reserved exclusively for ecosystem incentives, onboarding initiatives, contributor recognition, and community-driven growth.

---

## Brain Holder Rendered Cerebral Artifacts

**Brain holders** are entitled to receive a rendered Cerebral NFT representing a symbolic and cultural linkage to the Cerebral layer of the Bit Brains ecosystem.

Rendered Cerebral artifacts:
- Are art-focused NFTs
- Include an ENS-linked subdomain identifier
- Do not confer staking rights
- Do not emit rewards
- Do not participate in governance

These artifacts exist solely as identity and cultural primitives and do not constitute functional Cerebrals.

---

## Reward Distribution Framework

Cerebrals participate in protocol reward distribution through staking and epoch-based mechanisms. Reward emissions are sourced from fee allocations and epoch-defined distributions.

Base reward allocations are intentionally modest and scale through:
- Staking duration
- Participation across multiple epochs
- Ecosystem-aligned behavior
- Proof-of-care signals

---

## Reward Pathway Hierarchy and Proof of Care

The Bit Brains protocol prioritizes continuity, stewardship, and long-term participation over short-term extraction.

Brains represent the earliest and longest-lived commitment within the ecosystem and serve as the foundational backbone of the protocol. As such, Brains are granted access to the highest potential reward pathways.

Cerebrals form the second-order participation layer and receive meaningful rewards, with clear mechanisms to increase reward capacity through sustained staking and ecosystem contribution.

---

## Supply and Emissions Context

The Bit token has a maximum supply of **200,000,000 BIT**.

Approximately **90,000,000 BIT** may be minted across the first three epochs to bootstrap the ecosystem. The remaining supply may be minted over time, subject to governance, protocol activity, and proof-of-care mechanisms.

Cerebral rewards are not guaranteed, fixed, or unconditional.

---

## Security Considerations

Cerebrals introduce staking and reward mechanisms that require careful implementation to prevent:
- Reward manipulation
- Sybil behavior
- Premature extraction

Safeguards and audits will be addressed in future EIPs.

---

## Governance Considerations

Changes to Cerebral issuance or reward pathways are subject to governance processes defined in future proposals.

---

## Conclusion

Cerebrals extend the Bit Brains ecosystem by enabling scalable participation, reward alignment, and future autonomous intelligence development while preserving the primacy of Brains as the system’s backbone.
