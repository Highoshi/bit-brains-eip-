# EIP-0009: Cerebral NFTs — Phase 2 Eligibility & Rewards

## Abstract

This EIP defines eligibility, allocation, and reward rules for
Cerebral NFTs introduced in Phase 2 of the protocol.

It specifies Genesis Brain–based eligibility,
public mint parameters,
Epoch 2 reward distribution,
and enforcement via ENS-based identity and
zero-knowledge (ZK) verification.

## Scope

This EIP applies only to Cerebral NFTs in Phase 2.

This EIP does not modify Genesis Brain rules
defined in EIP-0008.

## Definitions

- **Cerebral**  
  A Phase 2 NFT governed by this EIP.

- **Genesis Brain (Brain)**  
  A Genesis Brain NFT governed by EIP-0008.

- **Epoch**  
  A fixed reward accounting period.

- **Staking**  
  Protocol-defined staking state for a Cerebral or Brain.

- **Proof of Care (PoC)**  
  Protocol-defined continuity proof for full rewards.

- **Secondary Rewards Treasury**  
  A dedicated treasury used to hold forfeited assets and
  undistributed rewards, tagged for future holder rewards.

- **ENS-resolved wallet**  
  The wallet returned by resolving the holder’s
  protocol-defined ENS identity.

## Phase 2 Cerebral Supply (Public Mint)

Phase 2 introduces a public Cerebral NFT mint.

- Total public supply: **3,000 Cerebrals**
- This equals **2×** the Genesis Brain supply of **1,500**

Purpose:
- onboard new Phase 2 participants,
- expand protocol participation.

All Cerebrals in Phase 2 follow the same
staking and PoC requirements defined in this EIP.

## Team Allocation (Longevity Reserve)

From the Phase 2 Cerebral supply:

- **10% (300 Cerebrals)** SHALL be allocated to the protocol.

These Cerebrals:
- SHALL be staked under protocol control,
- SHALL NOT receive preferential treatment,
- SHALL follow the same rules as all Cerebrals.

Rewards earned by these Cerebrals:
- SHALL flow into the **Secondary Rewards Treasury**,
- SHALL be tagged for future holder rewards.

## Genesis Brain Holder Eligibility (Phase 2 Claims)

Eligibility to claim Cerebrals in Phase 2 depends on
Genesis Brain compliance during Phase 1.

### Full Compliance (100%)

A Genesis Brain holder is 100% compliant if:
- the Brain is staked for the epoch, AND
- PoC continuity is valid for the epoch.

Entitlement:
- eligible to claim **two (2) Cerebrals**.

### Partial Compliance (50%)

A Genesis Brain holder is 50% compliant if
exactly one requirement is satisfied:
- staking without PoC, OR
- PoC without staking.

Entitlement:
- eligible to claim **one (1) Cerebral**.

### Protocol-Owned Genesis Brains (100 NFTs)

The protocol controls **100 Genesis Brains**.

These Brains:
- are staked, and
- do not provide PoC continuity.

Entitlement:
- eligible to claim **one (1) Cerebral** per Brain.

## Exit and Forfeiture Rules

A Genesis Brain holder who exits the protocol,
unstakes early, or breaks ENS or ZK eligibility:

- forfeits all pending rewards, and
- forfeits any unclaimed Cerebral entitlements.

## Forfeited Cerebral NFTs

Forfeited Cerebral NFTs:

- SHALL be routed to the **Secondary Rewards Treasury**,
- SHALL continue staking under protocol control,
- SHALL accrue rewards for future holder incentives.

These assets:
- SHALL NOT revert to the Team Treasury by default.

## Epoch 2 — Cerebral Reward Allocation

### Total Reward Allocation

Epoch 2 allocates:

- **20,000,000 tokens** total.

This allocation mirrors Epoch 1 in size and structure.

No additional minting is permitted for Epoch 2 rewards.

### Distribution Conditions

Rewards are distributed only while:
- Cerebral NFTs remain staked,
- PoC continuity is maintained (for full rewards),
- ENS and ZK eligibility remain valid.

### Compliance-Based Allocation

Rewards are allocated per Cerebral as follows:
- 100% compliance: eligible for **100% rewards**
- partial compliance: eligible for **50% rewards**
- non-compliance: eligible for **0% rewards**

### Undistributed Rewards

Any rewards not distributed due to partial or
non-compliance:

- SHALL NOT be burned,
- SHALL NOT be allocated to the Team Treasury,
- SHALL roll into the **Secondary Rewards Treasury**,
- SHALL be tagged for future holder rewards.

### Treasury Integrity

- Epoch 2 rewards are hard-capped at 20,000,000 tokens.
- Accounting MUST be deterministic and auditable.
- No discretionary issuance is permitted.

## Hypothetical Supply Disclosure

The final number of Cerebrals claimed by
Genesis Brain holders is not fixed.

It depends on Phase 1 compliance outcomes and forfeitures.

All Genesis claim quantities are illustrative until
Phase 1 closes.

A final reconciliation report:
- MUST be published before Phase 2 activation.

## Public Cerebral Mint

In addition to Genesis allocations,
a public Cerebral mint occurs in Phase 2.

All public Cerebrals:
- MUST follow the same staking rules,
- MUST follow the same PoC rules,
- are subject to the same enforcement rules.

## Enforcement

Eligibility and reward claims are enforced via:
- ENS resolution, and
- zero-knowledge verification.

No discretionary overrides are permitted.

## Non-Guarantee

- Reward rates are not fixed or perpetual.
- Parameters may be reassessed post-AIT.
- Total token supply will not increase.
- Accrued rewards will not be modified retroactively.
