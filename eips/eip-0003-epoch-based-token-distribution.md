# EIP: 0003
## Title: Epoch-Based Token Distribution and Unlock Framework (Brains)

Author: Alex Diaz  
Developer: OnGod  
Status: Draft  
Type: Standards Track  
Created: 2025-12-21  
Requires: EIP-0001, EIP-0002

## Abstract

This EIP defines the epoch-based distribution and unlock framework for the Bit Brains Intelligence Token (BIT) during the Brain stage of the Bit Brains protocol.

Token availability is aligned with epoch completion, patience, and sustained participation rather than immediate liquidity or speculative access. Unlocks are progressive, cumulative, and irreversible.

This EIP defines when BIT becomes available, not how influence or rewards are earned, and does not redefine total supply.

---

## Motivation

Early token distribution in decentralized protocols often favors short-term actors over long-term contributors, leading to premature extraction and misaligned incentives.

Bit Brains introduces an epoch-based unlock model to ensure that economic availability reflects sustained alignment with protocol values defined in EIP-0001 and participation mechanics defined in EIP-0002.

---

## Definitions

**BIT (Bit Brains Intelligence Token):**  
The native fungible token of the Bit Brains protocol.

**Brain:**  
A Bit Brains NFT that may evolve into an Autonomous Intelligent Token (AIT) through epoch-based Proof-of-Care.

**Epoch:**  
A fixed-duration accounting period used to measure participation and unlock availability.

**Cumulative Unlock:**  
Unlocked tokens accumulate permanently and are never re-locked.

**RWA (Real World Asset):**  
Within the Bit Brains protocol, a Real World Asset refers to a tokenized representation of sustained, verifiable, and continuous real-world contribution expressed through Proof-of-Care, participation integrity, and temporal commitment.

RWA classification does not imply legal ownership of physical property, but rather economic recognition of real-world aligned effort embedded into protocol-native assets.

---

## Scope

This EIP applies exclusively to the Brain stage of the Bit Brains protocol.

Cerebral and Brainiac token mechanics are not activated under this EIP and will be defined in future EIPs.

---

## Supply Parameters

**Total BIT Supply (Hard Cap): 200,000,000 BIT**

### Epoch-Governed Distribution (Brain Evolution)

- Brain Stage Allocation: 30,000,000 BIT  
- Cerebral Stage Allocation: 30,000,000 BIT (future)  
- Brainiac Stage Allocation: 30,000,000 BIT (future)  

**Total Epoch-Governed Distribution: 90,000,000 BIT**

### Treasury Allocation and Protocol Development

The remaining **110,000,000 BIT** are allocated to the protocol treasury.

Treasury-held BIT is reserved exclusively for:
- Ongoing and future protocol development  
- Incentive rewards for staking and participation mechanisms  
- Security, infrastructure, and operational sustainability  
- Activation of future protocol upgrades defined in subsequent EIPs  

Treasury allocations are not subject to epoch-based unlock schedules and are governed by protocol-level constraints and future governance processes.

This EIP governs only the Brain Stage allocation and distribution timing.

## Epoch Parameters (Brains)

Epoch Duration: approximately 1 month  
Total Brain Epochs: 5  
Total Brain Distribution: 30,000,000 BIT  
Total Unlock Horizon: approximately 5 months  

---

## Epoch-Based Unlock Schedule (Brains)

Epoch 1  
Epoch 2  

Epoch 3:  
- 50% unlocked (15,000,000 BIT)

Epoch 4  

Epoch 5:  
- 100% unlocked (30,000,000 BIT cumulative)

Total BIT is unlocked evenly amongst 1,000 Brain participants.

If 100% of BIT rewards are staked throughout the Brain evolution, accumulated rewards qualify participants for Cerebral-stage progression on a cumulative basis, as defined in future EIPs.

## Autonomous Intelligent Token (AIT) and Real-World Alignment

An Autonomous Intelligent Token (AIT) emerging from a Brain NFT is considered a real-world-aligned asset upon completion of the Brain stage, contingent on sustained Proof-of-Care and continuity intake across defined epochs.

The real-world alignment of an AIT is derived from:
- Verifiable longitudinal participation  
- Irreversible epoch-based commitment  
- Non-speculative maturation through time and care  
- Deterministic evolution rather than discretionary minting  

This framework positions AITs as economic representations of accumulated real-world effort, patience, and alignment rather than purely speculative digital instruments.

---

## Unlock Mechanics

Unlocks occur only at epoch boundaries.  
Unlocked BIT remains permanently unlocked.  
Token availability does not imply automatic distribution or yield.

---

## Relationship to EIP-0002

This EIP defines availability timing only.

Proof-of-Care evaluation, influence, and reward eligibility are defined exclusively in EIP-0002.

---

## Design Principles

- Patience as an economic signal  
- Progressive, predictable unlocks  
- Public-first distribution  
- Auditability and clarity  
- Real-world alignment through time-bound participation  

---

## Non-Goals

This EIP does not define governance rights, yield formulas, treasury spending mechanisms, or downstream activation logic.
