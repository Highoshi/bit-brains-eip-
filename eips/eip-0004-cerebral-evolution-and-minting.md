## Abstract

This EIP defines the Cerebral NFT layer within the Bit Brains ecosystem. Cerebrals function as the primary interface for staking, reward distribution, identity signaling, and future autonomous intelligence development.

This proposal establishes the structure, purpose, reward pathways, phase progression, and expansion mechanics of the Cerebral layer.

---

## Motivation

The Bit Brains protocol is designed to reward long-term alignment, continuity, and constructive participation over time.

This EIP introduces Cerebrals to:
- Expand participation without diluting core stewardship
- Enable staking-based reward distribution
- Support identity, ENS, and signaling primitives
- Create a progression path toward economic and autonomous utility

---

## Definitions

- **Brain**  
  The Genesis NFT representing the earliest and longest-lived commitment to the Bit Brains ecosystem.

- **Cerebral**  
  An ERC-721 NFT derived from Brains or authorized Expansion Epochs, serving as a staking, participation, and progression primitive.

- **Proof of Care (PoC)**  
  Sustained participation, staking continuity, and ecosystem-aligned behavior maintained across defined epochs.

- **Expansion Epoch**  
  A governance-authorized event introducing additional Cerebrals to support ecosystem growth and broader participation.

- **Real World Assets (RWA)**  
  Tokenized or represented economic activities, goods, or services that exist outside purely digital systems.

---

## Cerebral Overview

Cerebrals are ERC-721 NFTs that represent active participation within the Bit Brains ecosystem. They serve as the primary interface for staking, reward distribution, identity signaling, and future autonomous intelligence development.

Cerebrals may be:
- Earned through Brain participation
- Minted during authorized Expansion Epochs
- Utilized for staking and reward accrual
- Evolved into higher-order components over time

---

## Genesis Cerebrals

Each **Brain** is entitled to mint up to **two (2) Genesis Cerebrals**, subject to continuous Proof of Care requirements.

Genesis Cerebrals represent early alignment and inherit preferential reward pathways relative to later Expansion Cerebrals.

---

## Brain-to-Cerebral Progression and Minting Eligibility

Brains that complete the Brain stage may optionally qualify to mint up to **two (2) Genesis Cerebrals**.

### Eligibility Requirements

The Brain participant must:
- Fully stake the Brain NFT
- Fully stake all earned Brain-phase BIT rewards
- Maintain uninterrupted staking continuity throughout **Phase 2 Epochs 1–5**

Any early withdrawal, partial staking, or interruption disqualifies the Brain from full Genesis Cerebral eligibility.

---

## Expansion Cerebrals

To support ecosystem growth and broader participation, the protocol authorizes Expansion Cerebrals through governance-approved Expansion Epochs.

Expansion Cerebrals:
- Are minted under defined supply constraints
- Receive lower base reward pathways than Genesis Cerebrals
- Retain the ability to increase reward capacity through sustained Proof of Care

---

## Expansion Epoch I — Public & Treasury Allocations

- **Total Cerebrals Minted:** 1,500
- **Public Mint Allocation:** 1,350
- **Team Treasury Allocation:** 50
- **Reward Treasury Allocation:** 150

Treasury-allocated Cerebrals are reserved exclusively for:
- Long-term reward sustainability
- Ecosystem incentives and onboarding
- Contributor recognition
- Community-driven growth initiatives

---

## Secondary Market Royalty Structure

All Expansion Epoch I Cerebrals are subject to a **3% secondary market royalty**, enforced at the contract level and distributed as follows:

- **1% → Reward Treasury**
- **1% → Artist**
- **1% → Founder**

These royalties are designed to reinforce protocol sustainability, creative contribution, and long-term stewardship.

---

## Brain Holder Rendered Cerebral Artifacts

Brain holders may receive rendered Cerebral NFTs representing symbolic and cultural linkage to the Cerebral layer.

Rendered Cerebral artifacts:
- Are art-focused NFTs
- May include ENS-linked subdomain identifiers
- Do not confer staking rights
- Do not emit rewards
- Do not participate in governance

These artifacts do not constitute functional Cerebrals.

---

## Reward Distribution Framework

Cerebrals participate in protocol reward distribution through staking and epoch-based mechanisms. Reward emissions are sourced from fee allocations, royalty flows, and epoch-defined distributions.

**No BIT token rewards are claimable until the completion of Phase 2 (Cerebral Phase), at the end of Epoch 5.**

Any accounting during earlier phases is non-withdrawable and exists solely for eligibility and progression tracking.

Base reward allocations scale through:
- Staking duration
- Participation across multiple epochs
- Ecosystem-aligned behavior
- Proof-of-Care signals

---

## Phase Progression and Eligibility Summary

### Phase 1 — Brain Phase

During Phase 1, BIT rewards are distributed to Brain holders who complete Proof of Care and staking participation.

These rewards establish eligibility for Phase 2 progression.

---

### Phase 2 — Cerebral Phase

Brain holders may mint up to **two (2) Cerebrals** if they:
- Stake their Brain NFT
- Stake their earned BIT rewards
- Maintain uninterrupted staking across Phase 2 Epochs 1–5

Failure to stake both assets continuously reduces eligibility.

---

### Phase 3 — Brainiac Phase

At the completion of Phase 2:

- **Two (2) Brainiacs** may be spawned if both the Brain NFT and BIT rewards were staked continuously
- **One (1) Brainiac** may be spawned if only one of the two assets was staked

This structure rewards maximum continuity while allowing partial participation paths.

---

## Supply and Emissions Context

The Bit token has a maximum supply of **200,000,000 BIT**.

Cerebral rewards are not guaranteed, fixed, or unconditional.

---

## Security Considerations

Cerebrals introduce staking and reward mechanisms that require safeguards against:
- Reward manipulation
- Sybil behavior
- Premature extraction

Audits and mitigations will be addressed in future EIPs.

---

## Governance Considerations

Changes to Cerebral issuance, allocation, or reward pathways are subject to governance processes defined elsewhere.

---

## Conclusion

This EIP defines the Cerebral layer as a progression-based participation and reward system that prioritizes continuity, alignment, and long-term stewardship within the Bit Brains ecosystem.
