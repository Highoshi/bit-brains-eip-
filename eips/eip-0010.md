# EIP-0010: Brainiac NFTs — Phase 3 Eligibility & Rewards

## Abstract

This EIP defines eligibility, allocation, and reward rules for
**Brainiac NFTs** introduced in Phase 3 of the protocol.

Eligibility is determined by compliance across
Genesis Brains and Cerebral NFTs,
including staking and Proof of Care (PoC) continuity.

All enforcement is performed using
ENS-based identity and zero-knowledge (ZK) verification.

## Scope

This EIP applies exclusively to **Brainiac NFTs**.

It does not modify rules defined in:
- EIP-0008 (Genesis Brains)
- EIP-0009 (Cerebrals)

## Definitions

- **Brainiac**  
  A Phase 3 NFT governed by this EIP.

- **Cerebral**  
  A Phase 2 NFT governed by EIP-0009.

- **Genesis Brain (Brain)**  
  A Genesis NFT governed by EIP-0008.

- **Epoch**  
  A fixed reward accounting period.

- **Staking**  
  Protocol-defined staking state for an NFT.

- **Proof of Care (PoC)**  
  Protocol-defined continuity verification.

- **Secondary Rewards Treasury**  
  A dedicated treasury holding forfeited assets
  and undistributed rewards for future holders.

- **ENS-resolved wallet**  
  The wallet returned by resolving the holder’s
  protocol-defined ENS identity.

## Phase 3 Brainiac Eligibility

Eligibility to claim Brainiac NFTs depends on
staking compliance and Proof of Care continuity
across Cerebral NFTs and, where applicable,
Genesis Brains.

## Cerebral Holder Eligibility

### Full Cerebral Compliance (100%)

A Cerebral holder is fully compliant if:
- the Cerebral NFT(s) are staked for the epoch, AND
- PoC continuity is maintained.

Entitlement:
- eligible to claim **two (2) Brainiacs**.

### Partial Cerebral Compliance (50%)

A Cerebral holder is partially compliant if
exactly one requirement is satisfied:
- Cerebral staking without PoC, OR
- PoC continuity without staking.

Entitlement:
- eligible to claim **one (1) Brainiac**.

## Genesis + Cerebral Combined Eligibility

A holder who satisfies **all** of the following:
- stakes a Genesis Brain NFT,
- stakes **two (2) Cerebral NFTs**, AND
- maintains PoC continuity across all assets,

is eligible to claim:

- **three (3) Brainiac NFTs**.

This represents the highest eligibility tier
for Phase 3 Brainiac claims.

## Exit and Forfeiture Rules

Any holder who:
- unstakes required NFTs,
- breaks PoC continuity,
- transfers NFTs out of the ENS-resolved wallet,
- or exits the protocol,

forfeits:
- all pending rewards, and
- any unclaimed Brainiac entitlements.

## Forfeited Brainiac NFTs

Forfeited Brainiac NFTs:

- SHALL be routed to the **Secondary Rewards Treasury**,
- SHALL continue staking under protocol control,
- SHALL accrue rewards for future holder incentives.

These NFTs:
- SHALL NOT revert to the Team Treasury by default.

## Reward Enforcement

All Brainiac eligibility and claims are enforced via:
- ENS resolution, and
- zero-knowledge (ZK) verification.

No discretionary overrides are permitted.

Eligibility is evaluated at claim time.
NFTs are never required to be custodially transferred.

## Hypothetical Supply Disclosure

The total Brainiac supply is **not fixed** at this stage.

Final supply depends on:
- Cerebral compliance outcomes,
- Genesis + Cerebral combined compliance,
- forfeitures during Phase 2.

All quantities prior to Phase 2 close
are explicitly **hypothetical**.

A final reconciliation report:
- MUST be published before Phase 3 activation.

## Non-Guarantee

- Reward rates are not fixed or perpetual.
- Parameters may be reassessed post-AIT.
- Total token supply will not increase.
- Accrued rewards will not be modified retroactively.
