## Abstract

This EIP defines rewards for the **Genesis Brains** collection only.
Rewards are routed to the holder’s **Brain ENS subdomain** and enforced with **zero-knowledge (ZK) eligibility**.

Epoch 1 distributes **20,000,000 tokens** across **1,500 Genesis Brains**.
Each Brain can earn up to **100%** of its allocation when it satisfies:
1) **NFT staking**, and
2) **Proof of Care (PoC) continuity**.

If a Brain satisfies only one of the two requirements, it earns **50%**.
If it satisfies neither, it earns **0%**.
All undistributed rewards roll into a dedicated **Rewards Reserve Treasury** (not the Team Treasury).

## Motivation

Genesis holders need clear, auditable rules.
This EIP:
- makes **ENS the canonical reward routing identity**,
- uses **ZK** to prove eligibility without exposing private data,
- prevents ambiguous interpretations of “staking” and “continuity”,
- defines what happens to undistributed rewards.

## Scope

This EIP applies to:
- **Genesis Brains only (1,500 total)**

This EIP does not define:
- token launch mechanics,
- exchange revenue mechanics,
- future collections beyond **Brains, Cerebrals, and Brainiacs**.

## Definitions

**Brain**: A Genesis Brains NFT from the 1,500 supply.

**Epoch**: A fixed reward period for a defined pool and ruleset.
Epoch 1 reward pool: **20,000,000 tokens**.

**Staking**: Protocol-defined staking state for a Brain.
The Brain must remain in the staking wallet for the staking period to qualify.

**PoC continuity**: Protocol-defined Proof of Care continuity state for a Brain.
Continuity requirements are proven via ZK and/or protocol-defined checks.

**Brain ENS subdomain**: A deterministic ENS subdomain derived from Brain ID.
It must resolve to a wallet controlled by the holder.
Rewards route to the resolved wallet.

**Rewards Reserve Treasury**: A dedicated treasury address used only for future holder rewards.
Undistributed rewards roll here.

## Specification

### 1. Reward Qualification Levels (per Brain)

Each Brain is evaluated per Epoch for two requirements:
- **Requirement A**: Staking
- **Requirement B**: PoC continuity

Reward outcomes:
- **100% rewards**: A = true AND B = true
- **50% rewards**: exactly one of (A, B) is true
- **0% rewards**: A = false AND B = false

### 2. ENS Is the Canonical Reward Routing Layer

A Brain is eligible to receive rewards only if:
- the Brain’s ENS subdomain is set, and
- it resolves to a wallet controlled by the holder.

Rewards are routed to the resolved wallet.
If ENS is not set or does not resolve correctly, the Brain receives **0%** for that period and the undistributed amount rolls into the Rewards Reserve Treasury.

### 3. ZK Eligibility and Enforcement

ZK proofs (or ZK-compatible attestation) are used to verify eligibility while preserving privacy.

ZK verification MUST support:
- Proof the Brain is held by the claiming party (or the ENS-resolved wallet).
- Proof the Brain remained in the required wallet state for staking.
- Proof continuity eligibility without exposing private device data.

### 4. Transfer and Deviation Rules

If a Brain is transferred out of the ENS-resolved wallet during an eligibility window:
- the Brain’s eligibility for that window is reduced according to protocol rules,
- rewards for any ineligible portion are not paid to the holder,
- unpaid rewards roll into the Rewards Reserve Treasury.

This EIP defines the treasury destination for unpaid rewards.
It does not require a specific transfer penalty.
A separate standard MAY define additional penalties.

### 5. Claim-Based Distribution

Rewards accrue inside the protocol accounting system for the Epoch.
Holders claim rewards by presenting:
- the Brain ID,
- the Brain ENS proof (resolution),
- the required ZK eligibility proof.

Claim gas is paid by the claimant.

## Epoch 1 Reward Pool and Math (Explicit)

### Epoch 1 Pool

Total Epoch 1 rewards: **20,000,000 tokens**  
Genesis Brains supply: **1,500 Brains**  

Maximum allocation per Brain (if 100% compliant):
- 20,000,000 / 1,500 = **13,333.333...**
- Rounded for reporting: **13,333.33 tokens per Brain (max)**

### Protocol-Owned Genesis Brains

The protocol controls **100 Genesis Brains**.
These Brains:
- ARE staked,
- CANNOT provide PoC continuity.

Therefore, they qualify for **50% rewards only**.

Per protocol-owned Brain:
- Max per Brain = **13,333.33**
- 50% of max = **6,666.67 tokens**

Total paid to protocol-owned Brains:
- 6,666.67 × 100 = **666,667 tokens** (rounded)

Undistributed portion from protocol-owned Brains:
- The remaining 50% per Brain = **6,666.67**
- Total undistributed = 6,666.67 × 100 = **666,667 tokens** (rounded)
- Destination: **Rewards Reserve Treasury** (not Team Treasury)

### All Other Genesis Brains (Holder-Owned)

The remaining holder-owned Brains:
- 1,500 total − 100 protocol-owned = **1,400 holder-owned Brains**

Per holder-owned Brain:
- Max allocation = **13,333.33 tokens**

Compliance outcomes per holder-owned Brain:
- **100% compliant** (staking + continuity): receives **13,333.33**
- **50% compliant** (staking only OR continuity only): receives **6,666.67**
  - Undistributed remainder = **6,666.67** → Rewards Reserve Treasury
- **0% compliant** (neither): receives **0**
  - Undistributed amount = **13,333.33** → Rewards Reserve Treasury

### Summary of Treasury Rollovers

Any rewards not distributed due to:
- missing ENS routing,
- failed ZK eligibility,
- partial compliance (50%),
- non-compliance (0%),
- or protocol-owned Brains lacking continuity,

MUST roll into:
- **Rewards Reserve Treasury** (dedicated holder rewards reserve)

These undistributed tokens:
- SHALL NOT roll into the Team Treasury,
- SHALL be tagged for future holder rewards,
- MAY be reallocated by future standards or governance, if adopted.

## Security Considerations

- ENS routing reduces reward misdirection.
- ZK eligibility reduces surveillance risk.
- Claim-based payout prevents forced connection patterns.
- Transfer deviation rules reduce “stake-and-dump” reward abuse.

## Economic Considerations

- Fixed pool for Epoch 1: **20,000,000 tokens**.
- No requirement for additional emissions is defined here.
- Undistributed rewards are conserved in the Rewards Reserve Treasury.

## Backwards Compatibility

Not applicable.
